Some useful gadgets I developed for myself.

- ipynb-to-py converts the code and markdown blocks in your Jupyter Notebook to Python source files in a reader-friendly way.
- set-brightness sets the brightness of your screen.
- toggle-cpu-online allows you to enable / disable CPU cores. I use this to disable all but one core on my laptop when I want to save power.
